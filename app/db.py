"""Implements simple MySQL database connectivity for a Flask web app.

This approach is based on the "Define and Access the Database" Flask
tutorial [1]. It gives you an easy way to request a database connection or
cursor while processing a Flask request, and gives you access to that
connection from anywhere in your app (including other functions or modules)
until the request is complete.

This version of db.py uses the unofficial mysqlclient[2] package, instead of
the official MySQL-Connector-Python, as the latter currently appears to be
incompatible with Microsoft Windows 11. As of 24 February 2025, this version
has been verified as working on Windows 10, Windows 11, and PythonAnywhere.

Usage:
------
When initialising your Flask application, call `init_db` passing in your
`Flask` application object and database connection details:
```
>>> app = Flask(__name__)
>>> db.init_db(app, 'username', 'password', 'host', 'database', port)
```

Then, while handling a Flask request you can get a database connection
specific to that request by calling:
```
>>> db = db.get_db()
>>> # Your database code here...
```

If you need a new cursor, you can call:
```
>>> cursor = db.get_cursor()
>>> # Your database code here...
>>> cursor.close()
```

Alternatively, consider using a `with` block to ensure that the cursor is
automatically closed at the end of your query:
```
>>> with get_cursor() as cursor:
>>>     # Your query here...
```

Note that you don't have to close the database connection returned by
`get_db()` as it will be closed automatically at the end of the Flask request.
However, you should ensure that you close all cursors: this includes any
created by the `get_cursor()` function, and any you create manually using the
database connection.
